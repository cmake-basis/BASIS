# \file  Use.cmake.in
# \brief CMake use file of @PROJECT_NAME@ package.
#
# If this CMake module was already included before, it will do nothing.
#
# This module at first specifies the minimum required CMake version to
# guarantee that the CMake modules contained in this package are compatible
# to the used CMake installation.
#
# Then, the standard CMake modules required by any SBIA project are included.
# As the SBIA Testing CMake module SbiaTest.cmake has to be included after
# the project () command was used, that module is not included by this file.
# Instead, it is included by the sbia_project () macro. Similarly, the
# SBIA Packing CMake module SbiaPack.cmake needs to be included after all
# targets have been defined. Hence, it is included by the macro
# sbia_project_finalize ().
#
# Finally, the include directories to the header files of the contained
# prerequisite libraries are added to the CMake include search path.
