INTRODUCTION
============

  This document describes the directory structure of projects following BASIS.
  This structure is based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard of Linux
  (http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/FHS). The configuration of the installation
  was furhter designed to account for the differences in UNIX-based systems and
  Windows as well as the installation of multiple versions of each package.



LEGEND
======

  In the following, <project> is a placeholder for the project name in lowercase
  letters only and <Project> is the case-sensitive project name.
  
  Further, <version> is a placeholder for the project version string
  "<major>.<minor>.<patch>", where <major> is the major version number, <minor>
  the minor version number, and <patch> the patch number.

  The root directory of a particular project source tree is denoted by <source>,
  while the root directory of the project binary tree is referred to as <build>.
  Note that each software project consists of more than one project components
  (not identical to, but related with software package components).
  Each component can be downloaded, configured, build, and installed separately.
  See design-components file and section Source Tree for details.

  The root directory of a development branch such as in particular the trunk
  (cf. section Repository Organization), is considered relative to the base URL of the
  project repository and denoted by <tag>, while the base URL is referred to as <url>.



REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION
=======================

  The URL of the project repository is "https://sbia-svn/projects/<project>".
  The common directories "trunk", "branches", and "tags" are located here.

  - trunk/                      The current development version of the project.
                                Most development is done in this master branch.

  - branches/<name>/            Separate branches named <name> are developed in
                                subdirectories under the branches directory.
                                One reason for branching is, for example, to
                                develop new features separate from the main
                                development branch, i.e., the trunk, and merging
                                the desired changes back to the trunk once the
                                new feature is implemented and tested.

                                See guide-branches.

  - branches/release/           This branch is specifically used prior to
                                releasing a new version of the project.

                                See guide-branches.

  - tags/<project>-<version>/   Tagged release version of the project.
                                The reason for including the project name in the
                                name of the tagged branch is, that revision
                                control systems often use the last URL part as
                                name for the directory to which the URL's content
                                is checked out or exported if no name for this
                                directory is specified explicitly.

                                In case of SVN, the following command will
                                export the released software to a new directory
                                under the current working directory named
                                <project>-<version>/.

                                  svn export <url>/tags/<project>-<version>

  Under the trunk and the release branches, a version of the entire source tree
  can be found. Other branches under branches/ may only contain a subset of the
  trunk such as, for example, only the software component (see Source Tree).



SOURCE TREE
===========

  As the example data and the testing tree are not required in order to build
  and install the software, all files related to the software component of a
  project are separated from these two components on a directory level. This
  allows an SVN check-out or export of the each of these components alone.
  Details on the components of a project are given in design-components.

  It is important to note the difference between unit tests and system tests.
  Most often, only system tests will be performed due to the research character
  of the projects. These tests are usually implemented in a scripting language
  such as BASH, Python, or Perl. They simply call the built executables with
  different test input data and compare the output to the expected results.
  System tests can also be performed using the installed software. Unit tests,
  on the other side, are not supposed to be installed (and may not even be
  distributed to reduce the size of the packages). Unit tests test only single
  modules such as a C++ class. The size of the additional data required for
  unit tests shall be small. Entire medical image data sets are mostly only
  required for system tests.


  Directories
  -----------

    - PROJECT_SOFTWARE_DIR      := <source>/software/
        / SOFTWARE_CONFIG_DIR   :=   config/
        / SOFTWARE_SOURCE_DIR   :=   src/
        / SOFTWARE_DATA_DIR     :=   data/
        / SOFTWARE_DOC_DIR      :=   doc/
        / SOFTWARE_TESTS_DIR    :=   tests/

        / TESTING_EXPECTED_DIR  :=   expected/
        / TESTING_TESTS_DIR     :=   tests/

      / CMakeLists.txt            Root CMakeLists.txt file of software component.
      / AUTHORS                   Lists names of authors.
      / LICENSE                   Copyright and license notices.
      / README                    Root documentation file (readme file).
      / INSTALL                   Build and installation instructions.

                                  pre-computed lookup tables, for example.
      / SOFTWARE_DOC_DIR          Documentation files.
      / SOFTWARE_TESTS_DIR        Implementation of unit tests and test data.
         / CTestConfig.cmake      CTest configuration file.
         / CTestCustom.cmake.in   Custom CTest configurations.


  Example
  -------

  - PROJECT_EXAMPLE_DIR           Root directory of example component.
      / CMakeLists.txt            Root CMakeLists.txt file of example component.
      / (.*)                      Files required for example application.


  Testing
  -------

  - PROJECT_TESTING_DIR           Root directory of testing component.
      / CMakeLists.txt            Root CMakeLists.txt file of testing component.
      / CTestConfig.cmake         CTest configuration file.

      / TESTING_TESTS_DIR         Implementations of system tests.



BUILD TREE
==========

  Even though CMake supports in-source tree builds, it is recommended to have
  the build tree separate from the source tree. Only the files in the source
  tree are considered of importance as all files in the build tree are just
  generated from the files of the source tree.


  Directories
  -----------

    - RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY := bin/
    - LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY := lib/
    - ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY := lib/


  Software
  --------

    - RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY   All executables and shared libraries (Windows).
    - LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY   Shared libraries (UNIX).
    - ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY   Static libraries and import libraries (Windows).


  Example
  -------

  By default, nothing to do as the example files just need to be copied to some
  directory. These files are mainly just used as input to the programs without
  the need to configure or build them. The implementation of exceptions is up
  to the project developer.


  Testing
  -------

  \todo


INSTALL TREE
============

  When installing the software by building either the install target or
  running an installer of a binary distribution package, the following
  directory strucure is used.


  Options
  -------

    - INSTALL_PREFIX   Installation directories prefix (<prefix>).
                       Defaults to "/usr/local" on UNIX-based systems
                       and "C:\Program Files\SBIA" on Windows.

    - INSTALL_SINFIX   Installation directories suffix or infix, respectively
                       (<sinfix>). Defaults to "sbia/\${PROJECT_NAME_LOWER}"
                       on UNIX-based systems and an empty string on Windows.


  Directories
  -----------

  Based on above options, the installation directories are set as follows:

    - INSTALL_BIN_DIR     := "<prefix>/bin/<sinfix>/"
    - INSTALL_LIB_DIR     := "<prefix>/lib/<sinfix>/"
    - INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR := "<prefix>/include/<sinfix>/sbia/<project>/"
    - INSTALL_DOC_DIR     := "<prefix>/share/<sinfix>/doc/"
    - INSTALL_DATA_DIR    := "<prefix>/share/<sinfix>/data/"
    - INSTALL_EXAMPLE_DIR := "<prefix>/share/<sinfix>/example/"
    - INSTALL_MAN_DIR     := "<prefix>/share/<sinfix>/man/"

  Note that the include directory by intention always ends in sbia/<project>.
  The header files of a project have to be included as follows:

    #include <sbia/<project>/some-header.h>

  Hence, the include directory which is added to the search path has to be set
  to <prefix>/include/<sinfix>. Note that <sinfix> may include the project
  version such that multiple versions can be installed using the same prefix.


  Content
  -------

    - INSTALL_BIN_DIR          Main executables only.

    - INSTALL_LIB_DIR          Static and shared libraries. Moreover, utility
                               executables which are called by other executables
                               only. Furhter, the CMake configuration files
                               <Project>Config.cmake and <Project>ConfigVersion.cmake
                               are installed here such that they are found by
                               CMake when LD_LIBRARY_PATH on UNIX-systems includes
                               the directory INSTALL_LIB_DIR.

    - INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR      Public header files of static and shared libraries

    - INSTALL_DOC_DIR
        / README               Root documentation file. Links to other documents
        / AUTHORS              List of authors of the software project
        / LICENSE              Copyright and license information
        / ChangeLog            Generated from SVN history
        / UserManual.pdf       Guides user through example application
        / DeveloperManual.pdf  Describes implementation details
        / API/                 API documentation generated from source code, e.g.,
                               using Doxygen, Epydoc, Sphinx,...

    - INSTALL_MAN_DIR
        / man1/                Man pages of main executables.
        / man3/                Man pages of libraries.

    - INSTALL_DATA_DIR         Auxiliary data such as medial atlases and
                               pre-computed lookup tables, for example.

    - INSTALL_EXAMPLE_DIR      All data required to follow example as described
                               in User Manual.


  Symbolic links
  --------------

  On UNIX-based systems, the following symbolic links are created when <sinfix>
  is not an empty string and the option INSTALL_SYMLINKS is TRUE.
  Note that the link creation will fail if a file or directory with the links
  name already exists. This is desired and will simply be reported to the user.
  The projects files are yet installed in the specified installation directories.

    - If INSTALL_BIN_DIR != "<prefix>/bin" create symbolic links
      "<prefix>/bin/<exec>" -> "INSTALL_BIN_DIR/<exec>"

    - If INSTALL_MAN_DIR != "<prefix>/share/man" create symbolic links
      "<prefix>/share/man/man?/<name>.?" -> "INSTALL_MAN_DIR/man?/<name>.?"

    - If INSTALL_DOC_DIR != "<prefix>/share/doc/<sinfix>" create symbolic link
      "<prefix>/share/doc/<sinfix>" to "INSTALL_DOC_DIR"
