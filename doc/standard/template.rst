    :description: This article describes the software project template of BASIS,
                  a build system and software implementation standard.

================
Project Template
================

While you can create or use any custom template you like, it is highly recommended
that templates follow the BASIS :doc:`/standard`. In addition to the other standards,
for BASIS compliance templates must meet the requirements outlined below.

.. seealso:: The :doc:`/howto/use-and-customize-templates` How-to explains how to make use of templates.

**Benefits**

Anyone familar with the standard will be able to quickly
navigate the source tree and easily integrate your project into their own
because the setup is designed for consistency and interoperability. The 
idea is to make projects easier for developers to create, share, and use. 

BASIS Standardized Templates provide and automate the following steps:

- Configuration of the build, testing, installation, and packaging.
- Common directory structure which can be found at :doc:`fhs`.
- CMake_'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file setup.
- Basic build flags that are required.


Standard Project Files
======================

File Formats
------------

Standard project files utilize the following formats:

.. The tabularcolumns directive is required to help with formatting the table properly
   in case of LaTeX (PDF) output.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{3cm}|p{12.5cm}|

============================  ===============================================================
``.txt``                      A utf8 plain text file.
``.md``                       `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_ 
``.rst``                      reStructuredText_ 
``CMakeLists.txt``            CMake listfile format.
``.cmake``                    CMake listfile format.
============================  ===============================================================


Required Project Files
----------------------

The following files have to be part of any project which follows the :doc:`fhs`.
This is the minimal set of project files provided
when instantiating a new software project. Besides these files, a project
will have either a ``src/`` directory or a ``modules/`` directory,
or even both of them. See below for a description of these directories.


.. _README:

**README.md**
    This is the main (root) documentation file. 
     - Every user is assumed to first read this file, which in turn will refer
       them to the more extensive documentation.
     - Briefly introduces the software package, including a
       summary of the package files. 
     - Refer to the :ref:`INSTALL.txt <INSTALL>` and :ref:`COPYING.txt <COPYING>`
       files for details on the build and installation and software license,
       respectively. 
     - Include references to scientific articles related
       to the software package in this file.

**AUTHORS.md**
    Names the authors of the software package. People who
    notably contributed to the software directly should also be named
    here as well, even if they did not actually edit any project
    file. Others, who mostly contributed indirectly should be
    named in the :ref:`README.txt <README>` file instead. No author names shall
    be given in any particular source code file, as these are generally
    edited by multiple persons and updating the authors information
    within each source file is tedious.

.. _COPYING:

**COPYING.txt**
    Contains copyright and license information. If some files
    of the project were copied from other sources, the copyright
    and license information of these files shall be stated here
    as well. It is important to clearly state which copyright
    and license text corresponds to which project files.

.. _INSTALL:

**INSTALL.md**
    Contains build and installation instructions. As the build
    of all projects which follow BASIS is very similar, this
    file shall only describe additional steps/CMake variables
    which are not described in the :doc:`/howto/install` guide.

.. _BasisProject:

:apidoc:`BasisProject.cmake`
    Sets basic information about a BASIS Project and calls the
    :apidoc:`basis_project()` command.
    The basic project information, also known as metadata,
    will typically include the project name and release version, 
    its brief description which is used for the packaging, 
    and the dependencies. Note that additional dependencies may be given 
    by the CMake code in the :ref:`config/Depends.cmake <Depends>` file, 
    if such file is present. If the project is a module of another project, 
    this file is read by the top-level project to be able to identify its 
    modules and the dependencies among them.
    
    :seealso:`ConfigureBasisProject` explains using this file to configure your project.

**CMakeLists.txt**
    The root CMake configuration file. **Do not edit this file.**


Common Project Files
--------------------

**CTestConfig.cmake**
    The CTest_ configuration file. This file
    specifies the URL of the CDash_ dashboard of the project
    where test results should be submitted to.

.. _Settings:

**config/:apidoc:`Settings.cmake`**
    This is the main CMake script file used to configure the build
    system, and BASIS. Put CMake code required to configure
    the build system in this file. 
    You may want to:
        - Add common compiler flags
        - Add new variable definitions or modifying existing CMake BASIS variables
        - Write specialized code required to utilize dependencies
        - Make CMake ``configure_file()`` calls
    Examples:
        - Setting the project directory variables. The line ``set(PROJECT_SUBDIRS random)`` 
          will cause BASIS to call :apidoc:`basis_add_subdirectory()` on ``<source>/random`` at 
          the appropriate time during the execution of BASIS.
        - See basis/config/Settings.cmake for more examples.

**modules/**
    This directory contains independent project modules.
    If the project files are organized into conceptual cohesive groups,
    similar to the modularization goal of the ITK 4, this directory
    contains these conceptual modules of the project. The files of each
    module reside in a subdirectory named after the module. Note that each
    module itself is a project derived from this project template.

    :seealso:`/standard/modules.rst`
    
CMakeLists.txt Build Files
--------------------------

**build/CMakeLists.txt**
    CMake configuration file for performing super-build of external library 
    components and requirements by utilizing the CMake ``ExternalProject_Add()`` call.

    The source packages of the prerequisites are either:
      - downloaded during the bundle build
      - included with the distribution package. 
    
    In the latter case, these source packages should be placed in the ``build/`` 
    directory next to this CMake configuration file.
    
**data/CMakeLists.txt**
    This CMake configuration file can contains code to acquire or simply install
    every data file and directory from the source tree into the ``INSTALL_DATA_DIR``
    directory of the installation tree.

**doc/CMakeLists.txt**
    This CMake configuration file adds rules to build the documentation.
    For example, the in-source comments using Doxygen_ or reStructuredText_
    sources using Sphinx_. Moreover, for every documentation file, such as the
    software manual, the :apidoc:`basis_add_doc()` command has to be added to
    this file.


**example/CMakeLists.txt**
    This CMake configuration file contains code to install every
    file and directory from the source tree into the ``INSTALL_EXAMPLE_DIR``
    directory of the installation tree. It may be modified to configure
    and/or build example programs if applicable or required.

**src/CMakeLists.txt**
    This is the CMake file where your primary software packages are built.
     - Use the command :apidoc:`basis_add_library()` to add a shared, static,
       or module library, which can also be a module written in a scripting language. 
     - Use the command :apidoc:`basis_add_executable()` to add an executable target,
       which can be either a binary or a script file.
     - All targets can added to the ``src/CMakeLists.txt``
       file using relative paths.
     - If necessary, source code files may be organized in subdirectories
       of the ``src/`` directory. 
     - Typically subdirectories aren't necessary for less than 20 files.
     - Separate ``CMakeLists.txt`` files can be used for each subdirectory.

**test/CMakeLists.txt**
    Tests are added to this build configuration file using the
    :apidoc:`basis_add_test()` command. The test input files are usually put
    in a subdirectory named ``test/input/``, while the baseline
    data of the expected test output is stored inside a subdirectory
    named ``test/baseline/``. Generally, however, the :doc:`fhs` of
    BASIS does not dictate how the test sources, input, and baseline
    data have to be organized inside the ``test/`` directory.

**test/internal/CMakeLists.txt**
    Tests for internal use only that require data specific to your work organization.
    These files are expected to be excluded from the public source distribution package
    are configured using this CMake configuration file. Reasons for excluding
    tests from a public distribution include:
     - some tests may depend on the internal software environment
     - may require a particular machine architecture. 
     - The size of the downloadable distribution
       packages my otherwise be excessively large.
    
Documenation Files
------------------

**doc/manual.rst**
    The main page of the software manual.

**doc/index.rst**
    The main page of the project web site.

**doc/intro.rst**
    Introductory description of the project, will appear at top of website
    front page and at the beginning of the manual.
    
**doc/features.rst**
    Page listing project features that will appear after the intro on website 
    front page and at the beginning of the manual.


.. todo:: Update the list of standard documentation files because some are missing.

Advanced Project Files
----------------------

The customization of the following files is usually not required, and hence,
in most cases, most of these files need not to be part of a project.


**config/ScriptConfig.cmake.in**
    See the documentation on the :doc:`build of script targets <scripttargets>`
    for details on how this :ref:`script configuration <ScriptConfig>` is used.
    
**config/Components.cmake**
    Contains CMake code to configure the components used by
    component-based installers. Currently, component-based installers
    are not very well supported by BASIS, and hence this file
    is mostly unused and is currently subject to change.

.. _Config_in:

**config/Config.cmake.in**
    This is the template of the package configuration file.
    When the project is configured/installed using CMake,
    a configured version of this file is copied to the build
    or installation tree, respectively, where the information
    about the package configuration is substituted as appropriate
    for the actual build/installation of the package. For example,
    the configured file contains the absolute path to the
    installed public header files such that other packages can
    easily add this path to their include search path.
    The `find_package()`_ command of CMake will look
    for this file and automatically import the CMake settings when
    this software package was found. For many projects, the default
    package configuration file of BASIS which is used if this file
    is missing in the project's ``config/`` directory,
    is sufficient and thus this file is often not required.

**config/ConfigSettings.cmake**
    This file sets CMake variables for use in the
    :ref:`config/Config.cmake.in <Config_in>` file. As the package configuration
    for the final installation differs from the one of the build tree,
    this file has to contain CMake code to set the variables used in the
    :ref:`config/Config.cmake.in  <Config_in>` file differently depending on whether
    the variables are being set for use within the build tree or the
    installation tree. This file only needs to be present if the project
    uses a custom :ref:`config/Config.cmake.in  <Config_in>` file, which in turn
    contains CMake variables whose value differs between build tree and
    installation.

**config/ConfigUse.cmake.in**
    An optional convenience file for CMake code which uses the
    variables set by the standard CMake packageConfig.cmake file.
    BASIS generates a standard packageConfig.cmake file from 
    :ref:`config/Config.cmake.in <Config_in>`,
    which is used by other packages to set all the CMake 
    variables they need to utilize your package. 
    Example:
      - The package configuration sets a variable to a list of include directories
        have to be added to the include search path. ConfigUse.cmake.in would then contain
        CMake instructions to actually add these directories to the path.

**config/ConfigVersion.cmake.in**
    This file accompanies the package configuration file
    generated from the :ref:`config/Config.cmake.in  <Config_in>` file. It is used
    by CMake's `find_package()`_ command to identify versions of this software
    package which are compatible with the version requested by the dependent
    project. This file needs almost never be customized by a project
    and thus should generally not be included in a project's source tree.

.. _Depends:

**config/Depends.cmake**
    If the generic code used by BASIS to resolve the dependencies on external
    packages is not sufficient, add this file to your project. CMake code required
    to find and make use of external software packages properly shall be added
    to this file. In order to only make use of the variables set by the package
    configuration of the found dependency, consider to add a dependency entry
    to the :ref:`BasisProject.cmake <BasisProject>` file instead and code to use
    these variables to :ref:`config/Settings.cmake <Settings>`.

**config/Package.cmake**
    Configures CPack_, the CMake package generator for CMake.
    The packaging of software using CPack is currently not completely
    supported by BASIS. This template file is subject to change.

**CTestCustom.cmake.in**
    This file defines CTest_ variables which
    `customize CTest <http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_Testing_With_CTest#Customizing_CTest>`_.

      - 2.1/
      - .../

.. note:: Only the files which were modified or added have to be present in the new template.
          The ``basisproject`` tool will look in older template directories for any missing files.


Template Versions
-----------------

The template system is designed to help automate updates of existing libraries to new template versions.
Whenever a template file is modified or removed, the previous project template has to be copied to a
new directory with an updated template version! Otherwise, the three-way diff merge used by the
``basisproject`` tool to update existing projects to this newer template will fail.


Custom Substitutions
--------------------

The template configuration file named ``_config.py`` and located in the top directory of each project
template defines not only which files constitute a project, but also the available substitution parameters
and defaults used by ``basisproject``. The template configuration file requires a basic understanding
of Python syntax, but is fairly easy to understand even without much experience. To get an idea of the
syntax, take a look at the example below. A complete example can be found in the BASIS source
package in ``data/templates/basis/1.0/_config.py``.

    substitutions = {

      'date'  : date.today().strftime('%x'),
      'day'   : date.today().day,
      'month' : date.today().month,
      'year'  : date.today().year,
      # substitutions which can be overridden using a command option
      'vendor' : {
        'help'    : "Package vendor ID (e.g., acronym of provider and/or division).",
        'default' : "SBIA"
      },

        'help'    : "Package contact information.",
        'default' : "<vendor> <<vendor>-software at uphs.upenn.edu>"
      }
    }

.. note:: The substitutions are applied recursively up to a depth of 3. Hence, if the value of
          a substitution is another substitution tag, it will be replaced by the value of
          that respective substitution. See the ``contact`` substitution above for an example.

Binary Template Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, template files are assumed to be binary and thus no substitution is performed,
unless the template file is known to be a text file. Whether or not a template file is considered
to be a text file for which subsitution takes place depends on its `MIME type <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME>`_ . 
The ``basisproject`` tool uses the `Python MIME types module <http://docs.python.org/2/library/mimetypes.html>`_
in order to determine the type of each template file. In addition to the default types known
by this module, the file name extensions .cmake, .md, .mdown, .markdown, .rst, .dox, and .in
are treated as text files.
