Project Modularization
======================

This article details the design and implementation of the project
modularization, where a project, also referred to as top-level project
(note that BASIS only allows one level of submodularization),
can have other projects as subprojects (referred to as modules in this
context to distinguish them from the superproject/subproject relationship
in case of the superbuild approach, see below).
The project modules are conceptual cohesive groups of the project files.

A top-level project can also be described as a modularized project,
where each module of this project may depend on other modules of the
same project or external projects (also referred to as packages).
Note that an external project can also be another top-level project which
utilizes the same project modularization as discussed herein.
The idea, and partly the CMake implementation, has been borrowed from the
`ITK 4`_ project. See the Wiki for details on the `ITK 4 Modularization`_.


Implementation
==============

The modularization is mainly implemented by the :apidoc:`ProjectTools.cmake`
module, in particular, the :apidoc:`basis_project_modules()` function which is
called at the very top of the :apidoc:`basis_project_impl()` macro, which is
the foundation for the root CMake configuration file (``CMakeLists.txt``) of
every BASIS project. The :apidoc:`basis_project_modules()` function searches
the subdirectories in the ``modules/`` directory for the presence of the
:apidoc:`BasisProject.cmake` file. It then loads this file, to retrieve the
meta-data of each module, i.e., its name and dependencies. It then adds for
each module a ``MODULE_<module>`` option to the build configuration. When this
option is set to ``OFF``, the module is excluded from both the project build
and any package generated by CPack_. Otherwise, if it is set to ``ON``,
the module is build as part of the top-level project. These options are
superceded by the ``BUILD_ALL_MODULES`` option if this option is set to ``ON``,
however.

Besides adding these options, the :apidoc:`basis_project_modules()`
function ensures that the modules are configured and build in the right order,
such that a module which is needed by another module is build prior to this
dependent module. Moreover, it helps the :apidoc:`basis_find_package()` function
to find the other modules, in particular their configured package configuration
files, which are either generated from the default
:apidoc:`Config.cmake.in <BASISConfig.cmake>` file or a corresponding file found
in the ``config/`` directory of each module.

The other BASIS CMake functions may further change their actual behaviour
depending on the ``PROJECT_IS_MODULE`` variable which specifies whether the
project that is currently being configured is a module of another project
(i.e., ``PROJECT_IS_MODULE`` is ``TRUE``) or a top-level project
(i.e., ``PROJECT_IS_MODULE`` is ``FALSE``).

As modules are more or less independent subprojects, which might even be
maintained by different persons, it is desireable that naming conflicts are
handled automatically by the top-level project. Therefore, if the CMake variable
``BASIS_USE_MODULE_NAMESPACES`` is set to ``ON``, BASIS will take actions to
avoid naming conflicts. For example, the CMake build target names are prepended
by the name of the module in lowercase followed by a dot (.) as namespace
separator. By default, the ``BASIS_USE_MODULE_NAMESPACES`` option is, however,
set to ``OFF``. Even though modules shall be developed as independent from each
other or the top-level project as applicable, are they yet considered to be
closely related and their sources kept in the same repository. If a more loose
coupling of projects is desired, these should be separate projects with separate
repositories. These may then be distributed, configured, and build as part of
a common superproject.
