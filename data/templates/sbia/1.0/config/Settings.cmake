# @file  Settings.cmake
# @brief Non-default project settings.
#
# This file is included by basis_project_impl() after it looked for the
# required and optional dependencies and the CMake variables related to the
# project directory structure were defined (see
# &lt;Project&gt;Directories.cmake file in @c PROJECT_BINARY_DIR, where
# &lt;Project&gt; is the name of this project).
# It is also included before the BasisSettings.cmake file.
#
# In particular, build options should be added in this file using CMake's
# <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html#command:option">
# option()</a> command. Further, any common settings related to using a found
# dependency can be set here if the basis_use_package() command was enable
# to import the required configuration of a particular external package.
